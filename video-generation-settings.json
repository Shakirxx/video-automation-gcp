We'd been trying for a baby for three years, and the fertility treatments had finally worked. But when the ultrasound revealed not one, not two, but nine heartbeats, his face went white. \"Nine?\" he whispered, staring at the screen like it was showing him a horror movie. The doctor was explaining how rare this was, how miraculous, but David just kept shaking his head. \"This isn't normal,\" he muttered. \"This isn't what we planned.\" I reached for his hand, but he pulled away. That was the first sign that my miracle pregnancy would become my nightmare.\n\n## Section 2\nThe pregnancy was incredibly difficult. My body was stretched to its absolute limit, carrying nine babies. I was on bed rest for months, and David had to take care of everything. At first, he seemed supportive, bringing me meals, helping me to the bathroom, reading pregnancy books. But as the weeks went on, I noticed the change. He'd make comments about how \"unnatural\" this all was. \"Normal women don't have nine babies,\" he'd say. \"Maybe we should consider selective reduction.\" The idea of reducing the number of babies horrified me. These were our children, our miracles. But David saw them as a burden, as something abnormal that was happening to him.\n\n## Section 3\nWhen I was seven months pregnant, David started staying late at work more often. He'd come home exhausted and irritated, barely speaking to me. One night, I asked him to help me put on my shoes for a doctor's appointment, and he exploded. \"I can't do this anymore!\" he shouted. \"Look at you! You're like a science experiment gone wrong. This isn't what I signed up for when we got married.\" His words cut deeper than any physical pain I'd experienced during the pregnancy. I started crying, and he just walked away. \"I need some air,\" he said, and didn't come back until the next morning. That's when I realized he wasn't just struggling with the situation—he was disgusted by it.\n\n## Section 4\nThe birth was traumatic. I was in labor for eighteen hours, and it took a team of twelve medical professionals to safely deliver all nine babies. David was there, but he stood in the corner, looking pale and uncomfortable. When the first baby was born, then the second, then the third, I kept looking at him, hoping to see joy, excitement, anything positive. Instead, he looked like he was watching something disturbing. After the ninth baby was delivered, the room erupted in cheers. The medical team was amazed, calling it a miracle. But David just stood there, shaking his head. \"This is insane,\" he whispered. \"This is completely insane.\"\n\n## Section 5\nThe first few weeks with nine newborns were chaos. I barely slept, barely ate, barely had time to shower. David helped, but reluctantly. He'd feed the babies with a look of resignation, change diapers like he was handling toxic waste. One day, while I was nursing three babies at once, he said something that broke my heart. \"You know people are talking, right? They're saying we're like some kind of freak show. The woman who had nine babies. They're calling you the octomom of our town.\" I looked up at him, exhausted and hurt. \"These are your children,\" I said. \"Our children.\" He shook his head. \"No, this is your thing. This is what you wanted.\"\n\n## Section 6\nThree months after the babies were born, David sat me down for \"a talk.\" He'd been distant for weeks, barely helping with the children, barely speaking to me. \"I've been thinking,\" he said, not meeting my eyes. \"This isn't working. This whole situation... it's not normal. You're not the woman I married anymore. You're obsessed with these babies, and honestly, the whole thing is just... it's too much.\" I stared at him in disbelief. \"They're our children,\" I said. \"They need both of us.\" He shook his head. \"They need you. You're the one who wanted this. You're the one who refused to reduce the pregnancy. This is your choice, not mine.\"\n\n## Section 7\nDavid moved out the next week. He said he needed \"space to think,\" but I knew he wasn't coming back. The divorce papers arrived two months later. In them, he cited \"irreconcilable differences\" and requested minimal custody and child support. When I called him, crying, asking how he could abandon his own children, he said something I'll never forget: \"Those aren't normal children from a normal pregnancy. You chose to have nine babies. You chose to be a freak show. Now you can live with the consequences.\" He hung up, and I never heard from him again. I was left alone with nine beautiful, healthy babies who would grow up never knowing their father—not because he couldn't be there, but because he chose not to be. He called me unnatural for giving him nine miracles. I call him unnatural for walking away from them.\n",
